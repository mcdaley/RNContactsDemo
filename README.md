# RNavigationDemo
An example React Native app that demonstrates how to use React Navigation
to setup the layout for an app. The demo will show:

[x] * Tabbed Navigation
[x] * Stacked Navigation
[x] * Header Styling
  [x] - Text
  [x] - Buttons/Icons/Images
[x] * Format Header Title using Selected Item
* Drawer Navigation
* Modal Windows
[x] * Bottom Tab Styling
  [x] - Text
  [x] - Images/Icons
* Authentication Flow
  - Sign Up
  - Sign In
  - Forgot Password
*  Search Window
  - Add a search window in the header and link to a url/path

## To Do
* Figure out how to add the default header to the createBottomTabNavigator
  section. I have added the header styling to the createStackNavigation, which
  is OK for now.
