# RNavigationDemo
An example React Native app that demonstrates how to use React Navigation
to setup the layout for an app. The demo will show:

[x] * Tabbed Navigation
[x] * Stacked Navigation
* Header Styling
  [x] - Text
  - Buttons/Icons/Images
  - Search Window
* Format Header Title using Selected Item
* Drawer Navigation
* Modal Windows
[x] * Bottom Tab Styling
  [x] - Text
  [x] - Images/Icons
* Authentication Flow
  - Sign Up
  - Sign In
  - Forgot Password

## To Do
* Figure out how to add the default header to the createBottomTabNavigator
  section. I have added the header styling to the createStackNavigation, which
  is OK for now.
